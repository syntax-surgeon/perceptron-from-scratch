# perceptron-from-scratch

> Designing a simple discrete perceptron algorithm from scratch, without the use of external ML libraries.<br>_(current version: 0.1)_

> #### Author: _Siddharth Yadav (syntax-surgeon)_

### main.ipynb

- Contains version-0.1 of the main program which tries to implement a **discrete perceptron algorithm**
- The core of the algorithm is based on an intuitive implementation of basic **gradient descent**
- The current version of the codebase is functional, however, future versions may be OOP-based
- Simple plotting functionality is included to visualize the results of the training

#### Features planned for release 1.0

- Converting the codebase to an OOP architecture
- Inclusion of additional perceptron training features such as _'strict_reduce'_ and _'descent_type'_
- Advancing the graphing/plotting functionality to include intermediate perceptrons
- Proving a choice a datasets for testing purposes
- Increasing the verbosity of in-code documentation
